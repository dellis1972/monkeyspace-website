<p><strong>Here at ShinobiControls we have created a comprehensive set of powerful, interactive UI controls with a fully integrated Xamarin binding, to help cross platform developers such as yourselves, create awesome apps for businesses.</strong></p>

<p>All our controls are built with both the developer and the end-user in mind: we have a clear and logical API to delight the developer, alongside an ever growing amount of intuitive interaction that users now expect from their Apple devices. Our overall aim is to reduce the time, cost and effort involved in developing data-driven business apps, so that they can increase both in quantity and in quality.</p>

<p>If you are looking for controls with a high performance interface that will save you time and more importantly impress your clients and end-users then look no further! From single developer licences to our enterprise programme, we have plenty of different options available to suit.</p>

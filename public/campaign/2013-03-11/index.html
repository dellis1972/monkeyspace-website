                    <p>We have released a lot of information over that last few months about MonkeySpace. For those that do not follow the @MonkeySquareOrg or @MonkeySpaceConf twitter accounts, we thought it would be a good time to send an email out to get everybody updated.</p>

<h2>MonkeySpace 2013 Announcement</h2>

<p>We're happy to announce that MonkeySpace 2013 will be held at <a href="http://www.colum.edu/">Columbia College</a> in Chicago, IL from July 22-25. If you didn't notice, we added a day to pack even more content into the conference. Come join us, we'd be happy to have you. If you're on the fence, we've released <a href="http://monkeyspace.org">promotional videos</a>. They capture the energy, shows how approachable people are, and communicates our mission very well!</p>

<p>The early bird price is $250 and is available until May 15. Starting May 16, the ticket price goes up to $300. We also brought back student pricing by offering tickets for $99 to any active student. You can view the process by clicking the "Ticket Information" link under the "Register Now" button.</p>

<p>We also just opened the <a href="http://monkeyspace.org/call">Call for Proposals</a>. If you are interested in speaking at an event and have knowledge in cross-platform and open-source development in .NET/Mono, then we're the conference for you. All speaker levels are encouraged to submit, we had quite a few first time speakers at last years event!</p>

<p>MonkeySpace also has a hackfest to allow open-source developers to come together and develop on their preferred projects. We did this last year and it was a huge success! This year, we're going to take it a step forward. Once the hackfest is over or if you just want to show off your project, we're going to provide space for you to do just that! Please contact us at <a href="mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org">monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org</a> if you wish to participate this year.</p>

<p>If you're an open-source project owner and want to have a little sub-community event as well, we reserved a day for you to do just that. On Jul 26th, you can use the venue for free to continue work from the hackfest or have a sub-community get together to discuss the future of your project in one location. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org">monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org</a> if you wish to take advantage of this day. Also if you plan on attending, you may want to plan to stay Jul 26th as well.</p>

<p>If you or your company is interested in sponsoring MonkeySpace, you can <a href="mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org">request</a> our prospectus for more information.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that MonkeySpace is a welcoming and safe conference, all attendees and speakers are expected to accept and follow our <a href="http://monkeyspace.org/policies/">Anti-Harassment Policy</a>. Please make sure that you respect the policy. Our goal is to create an environment suitable for learning.</p>

<h2>MonkeySpace 2012 Videos</h2>

<p>In case you haven't heard, a majority of the videos from MonkeySpace 2012 have been <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/2142123">released</a>. They turned out awesome! Make sure you check them out if you weren't able to attend last year!</p>

<h2>Donating</h2>

<p>Like our mission and what we are doing? Well, you can help support us by donating! Monkey Square is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Help keep MonkeySpace alive and all the other projects we plan on having to help the .NET open-source ecosystem. For example, recording and editing the session videos is the single most expensive part of MonkeySpace. However, we want to provide the videos for free to help evangelize .NET development through out the world for those that don't have the means to come to the conference or pay for the videos. If you're able and enjoy the content we create, we hope you consider donating by visiting our <a href="http://monkeysquare.org/dontate">donate page</a> to learn more. Donations will also help keep the MonkeySpace conference ticket prices at a reasonable price.</p>

<h2>Monkey Square Shop</h2>

<p>We launched our <a href="http://shop.monkeysquare.org/">shop</a>! Help promote and support Monkey Square by displaying and wearing our schwag!</p>

                    <h2>Help Support Code Camp SDQ</h2>

<p>Today we're writing to ask for your help with one of the main missions that <a href="http://monkeysquare.org/">Monkey Square</a> was created for. That mission, is to evangelize cross platform and open-source development in .NET. We've started that mission with <a href="http://monkeyspace.org">MonkeySpace</a> and we're expanding that this year to help with <a href="http://codecampsdq.com/">Code Camp SDQ</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://codecampsdq.com">CodeCampSDQ technical conference</a> is a biannual conference taking place during the summer and winter, in Santo Domingo, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic">Dominican Republic</a>. It intends to educate the community of IT professionals of the Dominican Republic and foment a spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration at no cost to the attendees. The event is organized by <a href="http://megsoftconsulting.com/">Megsoft Consulting, Inc</a>.</p>

<p>The last event took place on December 1, 2012, with 249 attendees (due to venue and budget limitations), and over 600 signups before registration was closed. They held 4 concurrent tracks, with 3 time slots during 1 day, for a total of 12 Sessions. For the next iteration, they expect over 500 attendees, filling to capacity <a href="http://intec.edu.do">Instituto Tecnologico de Santo Domingo</a> (INTEC)â€™s campus.</p>

<p>Just a <a href="http://monkeysquare.org/donate/">$10-$20 donation</a> from everybody on this mailing list will go a long way in helping the Code Camp. We thank you for your support for this great cause!</p>

<p>MonkeySpace is approaching fast and we want to make sure you have the latest information.</p>

<h4>Monospace renamed to MonkeySpace</h4>

<p>For those that haven't heard, we <a href="https://twitter.com/monospace_conf/status/243998779290832897">announced</a> that we changed the name of the <a href="http://monospace.us">Monospace</a> conference to <a href="http://monkeyspace.org">MonkeySpace</a>. Some of you may be thinking, why change the name now? Well, one of our goals with <a href="http://monkeysquare.org">Monkey Square</a> is to educate and evangelize cross platform and open source development in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">.NET</a>. We have a great tool with <a href="http://monospace.us">Monospace</a> to help us with our mission, but we thought the name gave the conference a certain perception of only being about <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a>. In order to change that perception, we decided to rename the conference to better reflect it's mission. For the latest news about <a href="http://monkeyspace.org">MonkeySpace</a> and <a href="http://monkeysquare.org">Monkey Square</a>, make sure you're following <a href="https://twitter.com/monkeyspaceconf">@MonkeySpaceConf</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/monkeysquareorg">@MonkeySquareOrg</a> on twitter. We'll have other channels soon as well.</p>

<h4>Speakers and Schedule Announced</h4>

<p>We have announced the rest of the <a href="http://monkeyspace.org/#speakers">speakers</a> and the <a href="http://monkeyspace.org/#schedule">schedule</a>. The first two days are jam packed with sessions given by a great line up of speakers, old and new, speaking on topics from mobile development to developing sensor frameworks. The third day is an open space, where we turn the tables on you and allow you to come up with an agenda. We'll also have a hackfest during this day where you can help and learn how to contribute to open source software. Oh, we have an attendee party thrown in there as well, more on that soon!</p>

<h4>Conference Group Rate</h4>

<p>For the first time this year, we are offering group rates. If you're company would like to send more than 5 employees, <a href="mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org">contact us</a> and we'll be happy to provide more information.</p>

<h4>Hotel Group Rate</h4>

<p>The group rate we setup with Marriott expires on September 25, so definitely <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boscb?groupCode=mnomnoa&amp;app=resvlink&amp;fromDate=10/16/12&amp;toDate=10/19/12">book</a> your room as soon as possible if you plan on attending. Registration will remain open until we sell out.</p>

<h4>.NET Rocks Road Trip</h4>

<p>We're allowing the <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com">.NET Rocks</a> crew to crash the party during their <a href="http://dotnetrocks.com/roadtrip.aspx">road trip</a>. After the first day of the conference, come watch <a href="https://twitter.com/carlfranklin">Carl</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/richcampbell">Richard</a> record a show with <a href="https://twitter.com/dsyme">Don Syme</a>. I'm sure they'll have plenty of swag to pass out!</p>

<h4>Boston Code Camp 18</h4>

<p>Stick around after the conference and attend the <a href="http://www.bostoncodecamp.com/">Boston Code Camp</a>. The Boston Code Camp brings regional software development professionals together for the opportunity to immerse themselves in seminars, presentations, group exploration, and networking. Participants will be able to engage in their preferred technology, as well as to sample other options, with a focus on extending information exchange and enhancing the cross pollination of ideas. Mark your calendar! Boston Code Camp 18 is scheduled for the day after MonkeySpace on Saturday, October 20, 2012 at Microsoft New England R&amp;D (NERD), One Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA.</p>

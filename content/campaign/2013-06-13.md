## Group Rate Expiration

Just a quick note that if you need a hotel room and you haven't booked it yet, the group rate we setup with the Renaissance Blackstone Chicago Hotel expires on June 21. To start the process, just go to [monkeyspace.org](http://monkeyspace.org/#location) and select the appropriate link for the type of room you'd like. If you'd like to share a room with somebody, [just let us know](mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org) and we'll help you find a roomie.

If you have any problems or questions, please [let us know](mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org).

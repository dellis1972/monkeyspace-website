We have released information about MonkeySpace 2014. For those that do not follow the @MonkeySquareOrg or @MonkeySpaceConf twitter accounts, we thought it would be a good time to send an email out to get everybody updated.

## MonkeySpace 2014 Europe Announcement

We're happy to announce that MonkeySpace 2014 will be held in Europe for the first time at the [Ballsbridge Hotel](http://www.ballsbridgehotel.com/) in Dublin, Ireland from June 09-11. Come join us, we'd be happy to have you. If you're on the fence, we've released [promotional videos](http://monkeyspace.org). They capture the energy, shows how approachable people are, and communicates our mission very well!

The ticket price is €600 = $828 approximately. We also have student pricing by offering tickets for €99 = $137 to any active student. You can view the process by clicking the "Ticket Information" link under the "Register Now" button. If you are purchasing more than 5 tickets, please [contact us](mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org) about volume discounts.

We're a US based organization, but we had to take into account the difference between Euros and USD. Everything we are paying for is in Euros. If you're a US based developer, you may want to hold out for the US version of MonkeySpace coming this Fall.

## Call for Proposals

We also just opened the [Call for Proposals](http://monkeyspace.org/call). If you are interested in speaking at an event and have knowledge in cross-platform and open-source development in .NET/Mono, then we're the conference for you. All speaker levels are encouraged to submit, we had quite a few first time speakers at last years event!

## Sponsoring

If you or your company is interested in sponsoring MonkeySpace, you can [view our prospectus](http://monkeyspace.org/monkeyspace_sponsor_prospectus.pdf) for more information.

## Policies

In order to ensure that MonkeySpace is a welcoming and safe conference, all attendees and speakers are expected to accept and follow our [Anti-Harassment Policy](http://monkeyspace.org/policies/). Please make sure that you respect the policy. Our goal is to create an environment suitable for learning.

## MonkeySpace 2013 Videos

In case you haven't heard, a majority of the videos from MonkeySpace 2013 have been [released](https://vimeo.com/album/2481016). They turned out awesome! Make sure you check them out if you weren't able to attend last year!

## Donating

Like our mission and what we are doing? Well, you can help support us by donating! Monkey Square is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Help keep MonkeySpace alive and all the other projects we plan on having to help the .NET open-source ecosystem. For example, recording and editing the session videos is the single most expensive part of MonkeySpace. However, we want to provide the videos for free to help evangelize .NET development through out the world for those that don't have the means to come to the conference or pay for the videos. If you're able and enjoy the content we create, we hope you consider donating by visiting our [donate page](http://monkeysquare.org/dontate) to learn more. Donations will also help keep the MonkeySpace conference ticket prices at a reasonable price.

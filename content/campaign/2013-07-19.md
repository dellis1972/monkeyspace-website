## MonkeySpace 2013 is in three days!

Just a quick update on the latest info available for MonkeySpace 2013. We hope everybody is as excited as we are!

### Mobile Apps

We have an app available for all three platforms!

 * [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monkeyspace-2013/id562123362?mt=8)
 * [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.confapp.monkeyspace)
 * [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/monkeyspace/b3d33a17-e5e9-46cd-8b2d-401cbf07707e)

The iOS and Android apps are available in the corresponding app stores. We weren't able to get the Windows Phone app updated in time, so if you want to use it, feel free to build from [source](https://github.com/conceptdev/MonkeySpace) and install it manually.

### Getting Around

The best way to get around Chicago is to use the [CTA](http://www.transitchicago.com/). You can reach the hotel from either airport using the train lines.

### Attendee Party

Join us at [Celtic Crossings](http://celticcrossingschicago.com) for the attendee party sponsored by GitHub on July 23, where we'll start with an open tab at 8:00 PM.

### Conference Venue Address

We updated the [website](http://monkeyspace.org/#location) with the latest info on the exact building the conference will be held at on Columbia's campus. It's the Columbia College Media Production Center located at:

1600 South State Street  
Chicago, IL 60605

### Group Rate Room Available

We have a two queen bed room available at the group rate if anybody is interested. It's a first come, first serve offer. Just email [Dale](mailto:dale@monkeysquare.org) for info.

As always, if you have any questions, please [let us know](mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org). We can't wait to see everybody on Monday!

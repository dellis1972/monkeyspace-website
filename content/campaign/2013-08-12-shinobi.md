Once again, thanks for attending MonkeySpace 2013! We have a quick note from one of our sponsors, Shinobi Controls, who would like to introduce themselves.

...

We hoped you had a fantastic time at Monkeyspace 2013, we were delighted to be able to sponsor the conference. We are sorry we couldn’t attend this year but would love to attend in 2014!

Since we weren’t able to attend, we just wanted to introduce ourselves for any of you that haven’t had a chance to visit our website yet.

**Here at ShinobiControls we have created a comprehensive set of powerful, interactive UI controls with a fully integrated Xamarin binding, to help cross platform developers such as yourselves, create awesome apps for businesses.**

All our controls are built with both the developer and the end-user in mind: we have a clear and logical API to delight the developer, alongside an ever growing amount of intuitive interaction that users now expect from their Apple devices. Our overall aim is to reduce the time, cost and effort involved in developing data-driven business apps, so that they can increase both in quantity and in quality.

If you are looking for controls with a high performance interface that will save you time and more importantly impress your clients and end-users then look no further! From single developer licences to our enterprise programme, we have plenty of different options available to suit.

Check us out by taking a [free 30 day trial](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/shinobicontrols/price-plans/) today, if you have any questions then please get in [touch](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/contact), we would love to hear from you!

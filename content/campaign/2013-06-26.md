## Help Support Code Camp SDQ

Today we're writing to ask for your help with one of the main missions that [Monkey Square](http://monkeysquare.org/) was created for. That mission, is to evangelize cross platform and open-source development in .NET. We've started that mission with [MonkeySpace](http://monkeyspace.org) and we're expanding that this year to help with [Code Camp SDQ](http://codecampsdq.com/).

The [CodeCampSDQ technical conference](http://codecampsdq.com) is a biannual conference taking place during the summer and winter, in Santo Domingo, [Dominican Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic). It intends to educate the community of IT professionals of the Dominican Republic and foment a spirit of knowledge sharing and collaboration at no cost to the attendees. The event is organized by [Megsoft Consulting, Inc](http://megsoftconsulting.com/).

The last event took place on December 1, 2012, with 249 attendees (due to venue and budget limitations), and over 600 signups before registration was closed. They held 4 concurrent tracks, with 3 time slots during 1 day, for a total of 12 Sessions. For the next iteration, they expect over 500 attendees, filling to capacity [Instituto Tecnologico de Santo Domingo](http://intec.edu.do) (INTEC)â€™s campus.

Just a [$10-$20 donation](http://monkeysquare.org/donate/) from everybody on this mailing list will go a long way in helping the Code Camp. We thank you for your support for this great cause!

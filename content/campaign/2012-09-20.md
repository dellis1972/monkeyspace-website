## MonkeySpace 2012 is only 27 days away!
MonkeySpace is approaching fast and we want to make sure you have the latest information to make your time at the conference the best it can be. First, we would like to thank each and every one of you for registering for MonkeySpace. We look forward in meeting you next month! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [ask](mailto:monkeyspace@monkeysquare.org).

#### Monospace renamed to MonkeySpace
For those that haven't heard, we [announced](https://twitter.com/monospace_conf/status/243998779290832897) that we changed the name of the [Monospace](http://monospace.us) conference to [MonkeySpace](http://monkeyspace.org). Some of you may be thinking, why change the name now? Well, one of our goals with [Monkey Square](http://monkeysquare.org) is to educate and evangelize cross platform and open source development in [.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net). We have a great tool with [Monospace](http://monospace.us) to help us with our mission, but we thought the name gave the conference a certain perception of only being about [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com). In order to change that perception, we decided to rename the conference to better reflect it's mission. For the latest news about [MonkeySpace](http://monkeyspace.org) and [Monkey Square](http://monkeysquare.org), make sure you're following [@MonkeySpaceConf](https://twitter.com/monkeyspaceconf) and [@MonkeySquareOrg](https://twitter.com/monkeysquareorg) on twitter. We'll have other channels soon as well.

#### Speakers and Schedule Announced
We have announced the rest of the [speakers](http://monkeyspace.org/#speakers) and the [schedule](http://monkeyspace.org/#schedule). The first two days are jam packed with sessions given by a great line up of speakers, old and new, speaking on topics from mobile development to developing sensor frameworks. The third day is an open space, where we turn the tables on you and allow you to come up with an agenda. We'll also have a hackfest during this day where you can help and learn how to contribute to open source software. Oh, we have an attendee party thrown in there as well, more on that soon!

#### Attendee Party
We're planning the party as we speak and we would like some feedback. We setup a [little poll](http://twtpoll.com/rh6bd2) on whether you would prefer a dinner buffet or appetizers during the party. Please cast your vote if you have a preference. We plan on announcing the party info soon. If you're a vegetarian or gluten free, don't worry, we didn't forget about you.

#### Hotel Group Rate
The group rate we setup with Marriott expires on September 25, so definitely [book](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boscb?groupCode=mnomnoa&app=resvlink&fromDate=10/16/12&toDate=10/19/12) your room as soon as possible if you haven't yet.

#### .NET Rocks Road Trip
We're allowing the [.NET Rocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com) crew to crash the party during their [road trip](http://dotnetrocks.com/roadtrip.aspx). After the first day of the conference, come watch [Carl](https://twitter.com/carlfranklin) and [Richard](https://twitter.com/richcampbell) record a show with [Don Syme](https://twitter.com/dsyme). I'm sure they'll have plenty of swag to pass out!

#### Boston Code Camp 18
Stick around after the conference and attend the [Boston Code Camp](http://www.bostoncodecamp.com/). The Boston Code Camp brings regional software development professionals together for the opportunity to immerse themselves in seminars, presentations, group exploration, and networking. Participants will be able to engage in their preferred technology, as well as to sample other options, with a focus on extending information exchange and enhancing the cross pollination of ideas. Mark your calendar! Boston Code Camp 18 is scheduled for the day after MonkeySpace on Saturday, October 20, 2012 at Microsoft New England R&D (NERD), One Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA.

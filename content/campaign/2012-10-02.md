## Announcing the 2012 MonkeySpace Party Sponsor
We are happy to announce [GitHub](http://github.com) as the party sponsor! GitHub really doesn't need an introduction, but for those who haven't heard of them. GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over two million people use GitHub to build amazing things together. With the [collaborative features of GitHub.com](https://github.com/features/projects), their [desktop](http://mac.github.com/) and [mobile](http://mobile.github.com/) apps, and [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/), it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write better code, faster. Be sure to thank Phil Haack, Paul Betts, and Drew Miller for their support during the party!

#### Party Details

The party will be held at [The Meadhall](http://themeadhall.com/) starting at 19:00 on October 18, 2012. The 19:00 start time is very soft, don't feel you need to be there right on time. Feel free to take your time to grab dinner after the second day of the conference before heading over to the party. I'm sure we won't be in full swing until 20:00. We've arranged for an open bar as well as appetizers. We hope everybody can join us!

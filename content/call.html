        <h3>Monospace 2012 - Call for Speakers</h3>
        <p>Monospace is now accepting proposals for conference sessions. Proposals are due August 15, 2012 by 23:59 EST, but it's not a hard deadline. We want to make sure we leave room to cover the most current Mono and .NET open-source topics.</p>
        <p><strong>If you're a:</strong> Monoista, .NET/Mono hacker, Web developer, Embedded developer, Trainer, Mono system administrator or other interested, qualified person with insights and stories you'd like to share with the Mono and .NET open-source community, tell us about it!</p>
        <p>All proposals should focus on helping the Mono and .NET open-source community by teaching from experience.  We're specifically looking for a large number of advanced proposals.  Please be clear about the knowledge level of the audience you are targeting: novice, intermediate, or expert.  Most importantly, be sure to show code and LOLCATS!  Keep in mind that using the phrase "well actually" is extremely frowned upon.  Please keep the content of your presentation professional, if you're not sure what that means, ask.  Our goal is to create an environment suitable for learning.</p>
